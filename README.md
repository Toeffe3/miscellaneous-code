# miscellaneous-code
    
    TLDR:
    This is a repository for projects that dosen't need their own repository.

### What is this respository for?

    At times i watch Brady Haran's and simmalar channels or read intresting  
    coding-articles and decides to create a program (or rather function) to  
    use my newly gained knowlage to something so that is is not useless in-  
    formation.  
    
    This repository do contains sparetime-/oneday-/weekend-projects of code-  
    snippets. With inspiration from videos, code-articles or curiosity, and  
    in whatever language I feel like coding (usally JavaScript) therefor co-  
    de from my non-primary programming languages might appere here also.  

    Feel free to use any code or challenge yourself to do your own version.  
    Happy coding! ðŸ˜Ž
